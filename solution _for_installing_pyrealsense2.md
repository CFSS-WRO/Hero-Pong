# This is the solotion for installing pyrealsense2 library into jetson nano 

Normally, when we install library into our systme, we can install easaily by using pip install

e.g pip install numpy

However, when using pip install to install pyrealsense2 library, it cannot be installed successfully due to the following reason

1. PyPI lacks an ARM-compatible wheel
2. librealsense SDK isnâ€™t pre-installed

In order to solve these problem, we have to built it from source
## Installation process
### step 1:
Registration server's public key and install reresources
1. sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-key F6E65AC044F831AC80A06380C8B3A55A6F3EFCDE || sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-key F6E65AC044F831AC80A06380C8B3A55A6F3EFCDE
2. $ sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://realsense-hw-public.s3.amazonaws.com/Debian/apt-repo bionic main" -u
3. $ sudo apt-get install librealsense2-utils
4. realsense-viewer

if you complete these step successfully, you can find out a window that can view the information from the camera.

### step 2:
1. $ git clone https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense.git
2. $ sudo apt-get install python3 python3-dev
3. $ mkdir build
4. $ cd build
5. $ cmake ../ -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS:bool=true -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3.6
6. $ make -j5
7. $ sudo make install

if you completed the above step, you shold be able to find a file contain about the pyrealsense library

### step 3 
Move the file to site package
1. sudo mv (your pyrealsense library current locatation) (python site-package folder)

### step 4
run the python script
import pyrealsense2 as rs
rs.__path__

if it is work, the file path should be shown
